# MY FIRST CRUD IN OCAML

## NOTES

- sometimes `dune` decides not to work as a linux command, if that happens, run `eval $(opam config env)` and that should set things up for dune
- we need some to use some tools such as:
  - [esy](https://esy.sh/docs/en/getting-started.html);
  - [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/);
  - [dune](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/dune/);
